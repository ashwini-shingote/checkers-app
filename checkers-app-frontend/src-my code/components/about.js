export const aboutGame = `Here are the rules for checkers in a list format:
1. **Objective**: The goal is to capture all of your opponent's pieces or block them so they can't move.
2. **Setup**: Each player starts with 12 pieces placed on the dark squares of the three rows closest to them.
3. **Movement**: Pieces can only move diagonally forward, one square at a time, except when capturing.
4. **Capturing**: If your piece can jump over an opponent's piece diagonally into an empty square behind it, you must capture that piece. You can continue capturing if possible.
5. **Kinging**: When a piece reaches the last row on the opponent's side, it becomes a "king" and gains the ability to move and capture both forwards and backwards.
6. **Turns**: Players take turns moving their pieces.
7. **Winning**: The game ends when one player captures all of the opponent's pieces or blocks them from moving.
8. **Draws**: Draws occur if neither player can win due to insufficient pieces or repetitive moves.
Remember, these are basic rules, and variations may exist depending on the specific ruleset being followed.`;
